# playground
all interests and self-learning projects all in one ground.
my goal and purpose for this repository is to track record of how much experience and improvements i've made within an annual course.

# project references
<p>so, where do i get these references from? are these self-inspired? well here are some references that i could share with you, if you're interested to make projects of your own and within your own pace. The difficulty may vary, as these difficulties range randomly from beginner-friendly to advanced projects.</p>
<p>all the projects submitted to this repository are ideas from friends, the uncanny chatgpt, software engineering videos, and from online courses. feel free to clone this repository if you find something in need of improvement, or any form of advantage and learning for you.</p>
<p>here are my references:</p>

- **[build your own x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x/)**
- **[The Coding Sloth](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingSloth)**
- **[Pirate Software](https://www.youtube.com/@PirateSoftware)**

<p>shout out to these three main channels for inspiring me to do this, and an honorable mention to <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/carol-dweck"><b><i>Dr Carol S. Dweck</i></b></a> for inspiring me to start a journey to learn and improve my ability in this dark world, from all the books that I read from her.</p>
